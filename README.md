Sorting Algorithm Visualizer with AI Chatbot
An advanced, interactive web application developed using React and TypeScript that visualizes the step-by-step process of various sorting algorithms in real-time.
This project also integrates an AI Chatbot powered by Google Gemini API, enabling users to ask questions and clear their doubts about sorting algorithms and computer science concepts instantly.

Features
1- Sorting Algorithm Visualizations
    Bubble Sort
    Selection Sort
    Insertion Sort
    Quick Sort
    Merge Sort

Each algorithm is visualized in real-time with smooth animations, color-coded states, and interactive controls.

2- User Controls
    Array Size Control: Adjust the number of elements with a responsive slider.
    Animation Speed Control: Increase or decrease the speed of visualization dynamically.
    Array Regeneration: Instantly generate a new random array.

3- Visual Design
    Dark Theme Interface: Enhances focus and visual clarity.

4- Color Codes:
    Primary Blue (#3498db) â€” Default elements
    Accent Green (#2ecc71) â€” Sorted elements
    Comparison Red (#e74c3c) â€” Elements being compared

5- Smooth Transitions: Fluid bar movements and clean swapping animations.
6- Responsive Layout: Fully functional across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

7- Card-Based Information Panels: Neatly designed with soft shadows and rounded corners for better readability.

8- Real-Time Performance Metrics
     Array Access Count: Displays the number of read/write operations.

9- Algorithm Time Complexities: Shows Big-O time complexities during execution.

10- AI Chatbot Integration : Powered by Google Gemini API.
     10.1- Assists users by answering queries related to:
            10.1.1- How sorting algorithms work
            10.1.2- Time and space complexities
            10.1.3- Comparative efficiency of different sorts
            10.1.4- Other general computer science concepts

Users can interact with the chatbot directly inside the application for an enhanced learning experience.
